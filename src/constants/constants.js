She was succeeding slowly, opening new accounts across America, getting her creams into the better department stores, becoming known in a small way. Then along came Youth Dew. Youth Dew was, for Estée Lauder, what La Rose Jacqueminot was for François Coty — the product that opened the door to a whole new universe. Suddenly the money was coming in like never before and, at last, Estée Lauder and her family were on their way to becoming wealthy. Youth Dew was created as a bath oil which could be used as a perfume. While many dismissed it as ordinary, many more flocked to buy it. It was the right scent at the right time at the right price. In fact, for women, Youth Dew represented an opportunity to buy a perfume at the price of a bath oil."

Originally designed by Jean Rebull with a single dove, the design was later modified by Robert Ricci, Nina Ricci's son, and his friend Marc Lalique into the famous double dove design. It had been cited as one of the best examples of a perfume built on the pyramid structure associated with the method of Roure perfumer-teacher, Jean Carles — a base of low volatility materials, a heart that gives the theme of the fragrance and a top note that lingers for a few moments, as an introduction to the concert, so to speak."

Of course it was wonderfully popular for generations."

In 1930, as the Depression caused more and more grief to his wealthy clients (and, no doubt, to his own couture business!), Patou asked his in-house perfumer, Henri Alméras to create a lighthouse fragrance, a perfume that would make his business shine above all others and attact business, even in these grim times. Alméras concocted a fragrance using outrageous amounts of Bulgarian rose and French jasmine, pushing the manufacturing cost of the new fragrance to unheard of heights. After all, perfume was supposed to be bought cheap and sold dear. Couture was where cost and quality were demanded. Almeras worried that Patou had gone mad and the business was headed for the toilet. Yet the new fragrance, Joy de Jean Patou, proved a huge success. Joy helped save the business during these rough times and continues to be a favorite today — for those few who can afford it!"

She subsequently announced that her fragrance would be called No. 5, the name which already appeared on the bottle."

Even today an older bottle of Muguet is a great find, not just as a collector item but as a to-be-used perfume."
